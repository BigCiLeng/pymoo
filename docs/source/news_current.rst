**July 11, 2022:** It just happened. The new pymoo (version **0.6.0**) version has been released. Many things happened under the hood; however, the code base has changed quite a bit. The individual class has been reimplemented, and the meta algorithms can now be constructed much simpler. New algorithms have been added (G3PXC, RVEA, SMS-EMOA), and dynamic optimization problems and a simple implementation of D-NSGA-II are available. For more details, please have a look at the changelogs. (:ref:`Release Notes<version_0_6_0>`)


**September 12, 2021:** After quite some time, a bigger release of pymoo (version **0.5.0**) is available.
The project has made significant progress regarding its structure and has an entirely new module organization.
Even though there might be some breaking changes for users, it shall improve the clarity and readability of code in the long term. The documentation has gotten a completely new design and become responsive. In addition, some more algorithms have been improved (PSO, DE) and added (AGEMOEA, ES, SRES, ISRES). For more details, please have a look at the changelogs.
(:ref:`Release Notes<version_0_5_0>`)



**September 4, 2020:** We are more than happy to announce that a new version of pymoo (version **0.4.2**) is available. This version
has some new features and evolutionary operators, as well as an improved getting, started guide.
For more details, please have a look at the release notes.
